				<h3 id = "sectionAbout" >SECTION 1 | about</h3>
				<p>The Amino Blogging Assistant is designed for bloggers on
				the <a href "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.narvii.amino.master">Amino Apps</a> mobile app
				to stylise their blogs with unprecedented ease.</p>
				
				<p>In every community, you will find stunning blogs with eye-catching, evenly-divided paragraphs and
				beautiful aesthetics.</p>
				<img src = "sampleGIF.gif" id = "sampleGIF" alt = "Sample blogs">
				
				<p>But realise that users that do spend the time to make their blogs look so polished also end up
				spending hours, if not days, adjusting the margins, formatting, and spacing of their paragraphs.
				
				<p><i>Why does it take so much effort?</i></p>
				
				<p>The Amino blog editor is a plain-text (as opposed to a rich-text) editor. All the
				formatting is done character-by-character, line-by-line, with no shortcuts in-between. This means that those
				fancy indentations and spaces and lines that we see had been inputted manually (and painstakingly) by the user,
				with each style replicated on every single new line of text (rather than the formatting being on one paragraph).</p>
				
				<p>With the Amino Blogging Assistant, you can now format your entire blog paragraph with the push of a button.
				No longer will you need to spend hours breaking the 'Space' button to indent your text or squint your eyes
				to see if the text is lined-up. Simply select the formatting that you want for each line, and the Amino Blogging
				Assistant utility will automatically generate all the text formatting for you in seconds.</p>
				
				<h3 id = "sectionTutorial">SECTION 2 | step-by-step tutorial</h3>
				<h4>step 1: text alignment</h4>
				<p>The first step is to select your text alignment: either left or center alignment. 'Left-alignment' is set 
				by default. If you select 'Center-alignment', your text style will automatically generate the [C] tag attached to it.</p>
				<img src = "step1.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 2: text styles</h4>
				<p>The second step is to select from the four available text styles: <i>italic</i>, <b>bold</b>, <u>underline</u>,
				and <del>strikethrough</del>. In the Amino blog editor, these four styles correspond to the following tags: [I], [B], [U], and [S] respectively.
				You can check multiple boxes for multiple styles. If you do not want any text styles, leave all the checkboxes empty.</p>
				<img src = "step2.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 3: indentation</h4>
				<p>Here, you can specify the number of spaces that you want before your text as indentation. The spaces will appear
				after the text style tag but before the custom starter (see Step 4) and the actual line of text. If you do not want
				any space indentation, leave the value at 0. <strong>Non-integer values are invalid.</strong></p>
				<img src = "step3.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 4: custom starting characters</h4>
				<p>In this step, you can specify any characters or symbols (including spaces) that you want to appear after the space
				indentation but before the actual line of text.</p>
				
				<p>For example, you can enter '| ' (including the ending space) to generate this aesthetic effect with your paragraph:</p>
				
				<pre style = "font-size: 1em; text-align: left;">
| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
| meis sadipscing at mea. Cu eum
| falli saperet, cu vel suas
| magna solum, vix hinc posse
| omnesque te.</pre>

				<p>This feature supports special, non-keyboard symbols as well. If you do not want starting characters, leave this field blank.</p>
				<img src = "step4.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>line style preview</h4>
				<p>This line preview shows you what your line style will look like with your current settings. This updates
				immediately as you change the settings so you can see how your text will be formatted beforehand. If something looks
				amiss, you can return to the settings above and make any revisions accordingly until you are satisfied. <strong>Please note that
				you cannot type directly into that box; it is only a preview.</strong></p>
				<img src = "step5.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 5: maximum line characters</h4>
				<p>Here, you can specify the maximum number of characters that you want per line. The Amino Blog Assistant will
				divide up your paragraph for you based on that maximum character count. The minimum value is 15 characters per line.
				30 - 50 characters per line is recommended. <strong>Non-integer values are invalid.</strong></p>
				<img src = "step6.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 6: your paragraph</h4>
				<p>Enter your paragraph text into the box on one line. Then, press the 'Format text' button. Only one paragraph can be formatted at a time.
				<strong>Multiple paragraphs are currently not supported;</strong> the program may not run properly if you attempt to format more than one
				paragraph.</p>
				<img src = "step7.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 7: your formatted text</h4>
				<p>After pressing the 'Format text' button, the Amino Blogging Assistant will generate your formatted text according to your
				style settings. If you wish to revise your settings, just make the changes above and then press the 'Format text'
				button again to update your text formatting.</p>
				<img src = "step8.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h4>step 8: copy and paste into amino</h4>
				<p>Once you are satisfied, you can copy your formatted text and paste it directly into the Amino App blog editor.</p>
				<img src = "step9.png" id = "step" alt = "Tutorial">
				
				<h3 id = "sectionTips">SECTION 3 | tips and tricks</h3>
				<h4>1 | fancy fonts</h4>
				<p>Like to use fancy fonts? Those work here, too. You can copy and paste your paragraph text into font generators such as
                <a href = "http://www.coolletters.net/cool-fancy-text/">Cool Fancy Text Generator</a> or <a href = "https://lingojam.com/FancyLetters">Fancy Letters</a>.
                However, using the <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theruralguys.stylishtext&hl=en_US">Stylish Text</a> app may cause the program to crash.</p>
				<img src = "tip1.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tip">
				<img src = "tip2.PNG" id = "step" alt = "Tip">
				
				<h4>2 | custom start as fancy indentation</h4>
				<p>If you don't want to settle for the plain indentation, leave 'Indentation' at 0 and customise your entire line style
				in the 'Custom Starting Characters' field (including spaces), and you can create some very unique text designs. You can
    			copy and paste special, non-keyboard symbols from websites such as <a href = "https://coolsymbol.com/">Cool Symbol</a>.
